# Stochastic phenomena in pattern formation for distributed nonlinear systems
In this project we'll try to explore and learn the theory and methods behind a *stochastic spatially extended population model with diffusion*, where the coexistence of multiple non-homogeneous spatial structures in the areas of Turing instability is found. Scenarios of noise-induced pattern generation and stochastic transformations are studied using numerical simulations and modality analysis. This work will be mainly based on what is been already done in [[1]](#guide).
